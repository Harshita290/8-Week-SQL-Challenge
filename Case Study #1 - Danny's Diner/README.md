### 9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier — how many points would each customer have?

````sql
WITH price_points AS
(
   SELECT *, 
      CASE
         WHEN product_id = 1 THEN price * 20
         ELSE price * 10
      END AS points
   FROM menu
)

SELECT s.customer_id, SUM(p.points) AS total_points
FROM price_points_cte AS p
JOIN sales AS s
   ON p.product_id = s.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id
````

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_points | 
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | 860 |
